# Annotation

PowerShell is an object-oriented automation engine and scripting language based on Microsoft .Net open source framework with an interactive command-line shell that Microsoft developed to help IT professionals configure systems and automate administrative tasks. MS has also embedded this console into VS Code which provides a cross platform development, debugging and execution platform for PowerShell scripts.
